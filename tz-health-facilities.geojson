The surveys covered both Tanzania Mainland and Zanzibar.\n\nThe 2014-15 TSPA was designed to provide national-level representative results by facility type, that is, hospitals, health centres, clinics, and dispensaries. National-level representative results were also expected by management authorities, that is, public, private, faith based, and parastatals. The survey was also designed to provide representative results for each of the 25 regions in Tanzania Mainland and the 5 regions in Tanzania Zanzibar, for a total number of 30 survey regions."},"study_info":{"abstract":"The 2014-15 Tanzania Service Provision Assessment (2014-15 TSPA) is an assessment of all formalsector health facilities in Tanzania. The survey was designed to provide information on the availability of basic and essential health care services and the readiness of health facilities to provide quality services to clients. The 2014-15 TSPA collected information from all facilities managed by the government, private sector, parastatal, and faith-based organisations to provide a comprehensive picture of the strengths and weaknesses of the service delivery environment for each assessed service.\n\nThe 2014-15 TSPA provides national and regional-level information for all hospitals, health centres, clinics and dispensaries that offer child health, maternal, and newborn care, family planning, and services for sexually transmitted infections (STI), non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and chronic respiratory diseases), and HIV\/AIDS-related conditions. For each of these services, the 2014-15 TSPA assessed whether components considered essential for quality service delivery were present and functioning. The components assessed are those commonly considered important to various programmes supported by the government and development partners. The 2014-15 TSPA also assessed whether more sophisticated components were present, such as higher-level diagnostic and treatment modalities or support systems for health services that are usually introduced after basic-level services have been put in place.\n\nThe main objectives of the 2014-15 TSPA were to:\n\u2022 Assess the availability of basic and essential health services, including maternal and newborn care and child health, family planning, reproductive health services, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), as well as services for certain infectious diseases (HIV\/AIDS, STIs, malaria, and TB), in Tanzanian health facilities;\n\u2022 Assess the preparedness of health facilities in Tanzania to provide quality services;\n\u2022 Provide comprehensive information on the performance of different types of health facilities that provide these essential services;\n\u2022 Identify gaps in the support system, resources and processes used to provide health services that may limit the ability of facilities to provide quality services;\n\u2022 Describe the processes followed in the provision of essential health care services and the extent to which accepted standards for quality service provision are met;\n\u2022 Compare findings among regions, facility types, and managing authorities.","coll_dates":[{"start":"2014-10","end":"2015-03","cycle":""}],"nation":[{"name":"Tanzania","abbreviation":"TZA"}],"geog_coverage":"National coverage, the survey was also designed to provide representative results for each of the 25 regions in Tanzania Mainland and the 5 regions in Tanzania Zanzibar, for a total number of 30 survey regions.","analysis_unit":"Health institutions, hospitals, and health centers","data_kind":"Sample survey data [ssd]","notes":"The 2014-2015 Tanzania Service Provision Assessment Survey covered the following topics:\n\nFACILITY\n\u2022 Facility identification\n\u2022 General information and service availability\n\u2022 General service readiness\n\nHEALTH WORKER\n\u2022 Identification\n\u2022 Education, experience and HVB vaccination\n\u2022 General training\/ malaria\/ non-communicable diseases\n\u2022 Child health services\n\u2022 Family planning services\n\u2022 Material health services\n\u2022 Sexually transmitted infections - TB - HIV\/AIDS\n\u2022 Diagnostic services\n\u2022 Working conditions in facility\n\nOBSERVATION and EXIT\n1) Observation of ANC Consultation\n\u2022 Facility identification\n\u2022 Provider information\n\u2022 Information about observation\n\u2022 Observation of antenatal-care consultation\n2) ANC Client Exit Interview\n\u2022 Facility identification\n\u2022 Information about visit - antenatal care\n\u2022 Client satisfaction\n\u2022 Client personal characteristics\n3) Observation of Family Planning Consultation\n\u2022 Facility identification\n\u2022 Provider information\n\u2022 Information about observation\n\u2022 Observation of family planning consultation\n\u2022 Clinical observation\n\u2022 Pelvic examination\n\u2022 IUCD insertion and\/or removal\n\u2022 Injectable contraceptives\n\u2022 Implant insertion and\/or removal\n\u2022 Client's family planning status\n4) FP Client Exit Interview\n\u2022 Facility identification\n\u2022 Information about visit - family palnning\n\u2022 Client satisfaction\n\u2022 Client personal characteristics\n\u2022 Observation of sick child consultation\n\u2022 Provider interaction with caretaker and child\n\u2022 Diagnosis\n\u2022 Treatment\n5) Sick Child Caretaker Exit Interview\n\u2022 Facility identification\n\u2022 Information about visit - caretaker of sick child\n    o Client age\n    o Signs and symptoms of current illness\n    o Information provided to caretaker\n    o Treatment and caretaker comfort level\n    o Referral\n\u2022 Client satisfaction\n\u2022 Client personal characteristics"},"method":{"data_collection":{"data_collectors":[{"name":"National Bureau of Statistics","abbreviation":"NBS","affiliation":"Government of Tanzania"}],"sampling_procedure":"The 2014-15 TSPA was designed to be a sample survey of all formal-sector health facilities in Tanzania. A master list of health facilities that consisted of 7,102 verified (active) health facilities in Tanzania was obtained from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) on the Tanzania Mainland and the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Zanzibar. The list included hospitals, health centres, dispensaries, and clinics. These facilities were managed by the government, private-for-profit, parastatal, and faith-based entities.\n\nA sample of 1,200 facilities was selected to participate in the survey. The sample was designed to provide nationally representative results by facility type and managing authority and regionally representative results for the 25 Tanzania Mainland regions and the 5 Zanzibar regions (a total of 30 survey regions).","coll_mode":"Face-to-face [f2f]","research_instrument":"Four questionnaires were used to collect the survey data:\n\u2022 Facility Inventory questionnaire\n\u2022 Health Provider Interview questionnaire\n\u2022 Observation Protocols for antenatal care (ANC), family planning, services for sick children, and normal obstetric delivery and immediate newborn care\n\u2022 Exit Interview questionnaires for ANC and family planning clients and for caretakers of sick children whose consultations were observed.\n\nThe Facility Inventory questionnaire was loaded onto tablet computers and administered as computerassisted personal interviews (CAPI). The other questionnaire types were administered as paper questionnaires but with data entry and data editing taking place immediately following data collection and while the team was still in the facility (computer-assisted field editing \u2013 CAFE).","coll_situation":"Main Training\nAs part of the preparations for the 2014-15 TSPA main training, the eight health providers and five staff (four from NBS and one from OCGS) who participated during the pre-test were given a training of trainers (TOT) for four days, September 10\u201313, 2014. The training, led by ICF International survey specialists, was intended to equip participants with the necessary skills for them to be in charge of the main training as facilitators.\n\nParticipants were introduced to tablet computers, and then transitioned to the use of the tablet computers for data collection (CAPI) and for data entry and editing (CAFE); this was done using completed paper questionnaires from the facilities visited during the pre-test and from field practice during the first two weeks of main training. For the duration of the third week, participants practiced all questionnaire types and CAPI and CAFE approaches in teams and in pairs.\n\nThe training involved about 90 nurses from all over the country who were trained to be interviewers. The number of nurses\/interviewers was reduced to 67 after selecting those who performed best on a series of practical tests and examinations.\n\nData Collection\nFollowing the training of interviewers, 20 teams were formed (2 for Zanzibar and 18 for Tanzania Mainland). Each team consisted of a team leader, 3 interviewers and a driver. Each team was provided two tablet computers. One was dedicated to CAPI for the Facility Inventory, and the other was dedicated to CAFE for entering responses to the paper-based Health Provider Interview and Exit Interview questionnaires as well as observation protocols. Each team was given a list of facilities to visit, including name, type, and location. On average, data collection took one day for a small facility (dispensary clinics and some health centres) and two or three days for large facilities (mostly hospitals). Every effort was made to assure that teams visited facilities on days when ANC, family planning, or sick child services were offered, because the assessment involved observation of these consultations. Whenever any of the services of interest was not being offered on the day of the visit, the teams returned on a day when the service was offered to observe consultations and interview clients. If, however, the service was offered on the day of the visit but no clients came for this service, the team did not revisit the facility.\n\nInterviewers ensured that respondents to the Facility Inventory questionnaire sections were the most knowledgeable persons for the particular service or system components being assessed.\n\nFieldwork supervision was coordinated by NBS. Four NBS staff and three MoHSW representatives were responsible for field supervision and made periodic visits to teams to review work and monitor data quality.\n\nData collection for the 2014-15 TSPA took place from October 20 \u2013 February 21. There was a revisit of some facilities that were not covered in Dar es Salaam from March 2-13.","cleaning_operations":"After completing data collection in each facility, the interviewers reviewed the paper questionnaires (Health Provider Interview, Exit Interview and Observation) and the Inventory data that had been collected directly onto the tablet computer before handing the questionnaires and electronic data over to the team leader, who reviewed them a second time. The paper questionnaires were then entered into the second tablet computer. Once data collection and all data entry were completed in a facility, the team leader conducted consistency and structural checks on the data to identify any errors or missing information. When a team was satisfied that data collection and entry were complete for the facility, the team sent the data to the NBS headquarters in Dar es Salaam via the Internet, using ICF International\u2019s Internet File Steaming System (IFSS). Each team was given a modem device that enabled the tablet computer to send the completed data files to the central office. Questionnaires completed during the 2014-15 TSPA fieldwork were periodically gathered up by quality control teams and taken from the field to be processed at the NBS headquarters in Dar es Salaam. Processing consisted of data entry and the editing of computer-identified errors. The data were processed by a team of 5 data entry clerks, 1 questionnaire administrator, and 2 data entry supervisors. The questionnaire administrator was responsible for receiving the questionnaires from the field. A program developed by ICF International using CSPro software was employed for data entry. At the central office, the data from the paper questionnaires were entered twice (100 percent verification). The concurrent processing of the data was a distinct advantage for data quality because 2014-15 TSPA staff were able to advise the field teams of errors detected during data entry. Data entry started in October 2014, two weeks after the beginning of fieldwork, and ended in March 2015, two weeks after fieldwork ended. All responses with \u201cother\u201d category were reviewed by NBS with assistance from the MoHSW staff and were recorded in categories relevant for data analysis."},"analysis_info":{"response_rate":"1,200 health facilities sampled in the 2014-15 TSPA. Seven sampled facilities refused to be surveyed, 4 had closed down, and one facility could not be reached.
